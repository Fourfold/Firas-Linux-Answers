1. **Explain the difference between `ls -l` and `ls -a`. What specific information does each option provide?**
   
   - `ls -l` is used to list the files and directories present in the working directory (excluding hidden files) in detail. Details include file type, permissions for user, group, and others, number of files in each files (1 for files and n for directories), date of creation, and file name. `ls -a` does not provide all these details. It only provides the file names, but it includes the hidden files, current directory, and parent directory.
2. **Describe a scenario where using `mkdir` might fail and how to handle such a failure programmatically.**
   
   - `mkdir` might fail if a file with the same name exists, or if the current user does not have permission to write in the current directory. In this case, permissions should be given using `chmod`.
3. **How can you use the `cat` command to concatenate the contents of two files into a new file? Provide the command syntax.**

- `cat file1 > newFile; cat file2 >> newFile`.

4. **What is the primary difference between the `cat` and `touch` commands when it comes to file creation?**

- `cat` can create only one file at a time, while `touch` can be used to create multiple files.

5. **Explain the use of wildcards with the `cp` command to copy multiple files at once. Provide an example.**

- `cat` can create only one file at a time, while `touch` can be used to create multiple files.
